# üöÄ ChatBot AI  

# 1. Introduction 
This document provides a detailed overview of the enhancements and structure of a multicomponent chatbot system that integrates text generation, image processing (computer vision), 
and SQL query handling. The system uses a ReAct-based approach (Reasoning + Acting) to process 
user requests, generate suitable responses, and optionally handle images and SQL queries.

# 2. System Components

   ## 2.1 - ChatbotController
   - Central class that orchestrates interactions between different modules.

   - Maintains in-memory conversation history and decides when to invoke SQL operations or image-processing tasks.

   - Utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to generate context-relevant responses following the ReAct pattern.
   ## 2.2 - Routes
   - **chat.py**
      - Provides the /chat endpoint to handle user requests.
      - Accepts session_id, user_id, user_query, an optional conversation_history, and car_details.
      - Delegates response generation or SQL query handling to ChatbotController.
   - **image.py**
      - Offers the /image endpoint for file uploads (JPG, JPEG, PNG).
      - Validates file types, reads file contents in memory, and uses ChatbotController to extract details via vision processing.
   ## 2.3 - Models
   - **ChatRequest**
      - Encapsulates user inputs such as session_id, user_id, user_query, optional conversation_history, and car_details.
   - **ChatResponse**
      - Contains the chatbot‚Äôs generated response text.
   - **ImageUploadResponse**
      - Holds information extracted from the uploaded image.

# 3. Technical Highlights
   ## **3.1 - ReAct Methodology**
   * The chatbot employs a step-by-step reasoning approach to interpret and respond to user prompts:
      - **Thought**: Analyze the prompt internally.
      -  **Action**: Execute an action, such as calling a tool (SQL or image processing).
      - **Observation**:: Incorporate the tool‚Äôs output into subsequent reasoning steps
      - **Answer**: Provide the final response.

   ## **3.2 In-Memory Conversation Management**
   - The system tracks conversations by (session_id, user_id) pairs, allowing for multiple sessions concurrently.

   - Facilitates easy retrieval and updating of conversation context to deliver personalized context-aware interactions.
   
   ## **3.3 Modular Design**
   - Separating functionalities into distinct route files (chat.py and image.py) ensures clarity and maintainability

   - The ChatbotController coordinates logic, while specialized controllers (e.g., SQL_AgentController) handle domain-specific tasks.

   ## **4. Error Handling & Logging**
   - Thorough logging of exceptions and error details ensures operational visibility.

   - The system raises meaningful HTTP exceptions, aiding in rapid debugging and 
transparent communication with the front end

   ## **5. Deployment on Render**
   - The service is currently hosted on Render at 
   **[Deployment Link](https://test-api-qdtz.onrender.com/)**  
   - Render offers convenient deployment workflows, automatic scaling, and continuous integration capabilities

# 4. Benefits of the Updated System
   ## **4.1 - Readability & Maintainability**
   - The code now uses English docstrings and method signatures, making it more 
approachable for broader teams.
   - Modular controllers with explicit responsibilities facilitate easier updates and 
feature expansions.

   ## **4.2 - Scalable Architecture**
   - Suited for parallel handling of text-based user queries, SQL queries, and image 
analysis
   - Open for future extensions, like integrating additional AI tools or new backends for 
text generation
   ## **4.3 - Enhanced User Experience**
   - The ReAct approach ensures deeper context understanding, enabling the chatbot to 
reason effectively about user requests.
   - Direct processing of images (extracting car details, for example) enriches the scope 
of user interactions.

   ## **4.4 - Consistent Error Response**
   - Unified error handling across text generation, image processing, and SQL 
operations reduces uncertainty and aids in debugging.

   ## **4.5 - Centralized Conversation Logic**
   - By storing and retrieving conversation data in a single place (conversation_store), 
the system can easily maintain continuity across multiple user turns.

# 5. Example Workflow

   ## **5.1 - User Sends a Chat Request**
   - A POST to /chat with session_id, user_id, and user_query.
   - The controller retrieves past conversation data (if any) and passes it to the LLM.
   - A response is generated, appended to the conversation history, and returned as 
ChatResponse.

   ## **5.2 - User Uploads an Image**
   - A POST to /image with a JPG, JPEG, or PNG file
   - The file is read in memory, validated for type, then processed by the vision client in 
ChatbotController
   - Extracted details are returned in ImageUploadResponse.
   ## **5.3 - ReAct Decision-Making**
   - The chatbot identifies whether it needs to invoke a special ‚Äútool‚Äù (e.g., SQL, image 
processing) by analyzing the user‚Äôs prompt.
   - If an SQL query is needed, SQL_AgentController runs the query, returns results, 
which then feed back into the conversation.
